                        <p class="mb-30">I was contracted to do a <b>complete overhaul of the website's front-end.</b> Assess issues with the old UX design, and develop a UI that gives the website a more updated look and feel.  </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="title mb-30">Challenge</h2>
                        
                        <p class="mb-30">The website is unfamiliar, complex and outdated (i.e. no one has updated the site’s UI or navigation since its creation in 2005); additionally, the original developer is no longer under their employment. According to the client, a lot of the most important information was not easily accessible. <b>There were also a lot of dead-ends and irrelevant or outdated information throughout the site.</b> </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="title mb-30">Solution and Implementation</h2>

                        <p class="mb-30">While reviewing each page, I simultaneously created a site map. This allowed me to <b>streamline my review process, gain an in-depth understanding of the product and create the documentation</b> I would later need to pinpoint usability issues to those unfamiliar with the site’s complexity. I then interviewed the client on what his goals were for the website to gain an understanding of what they valued as important in the site. <br> Using the site-map as a guide alongside the information gained from interviewing the client, <b>I was able to mock-up a new design </b> which emphasized the most important information and gave the website a more clean and updated feel. The mock-up allowed the client to get a clear understanding of the new design before starting development. After approving the mock-up with the client <b>I coded the HTML, CSS, and some of the JS of the design </b> with the collaboration of a back-end developer to finish the project. </p>
